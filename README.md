Unofficial JS module for interacting with the DiscordBot.World API

Fully working with the DiscordBot.World API!

To get started, create the client:
```js
const Discord = require("discord.js");
const client = new Discord.Client();

var dbwapi = require('discordbotworld-api');
const dbw = new dbwapi('DiscordBotWorld Token', client);
```
For how to use all the features, or to see more info about setting it up, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/iDerp/discordbotworld-api/wiki)!


If you would like more than just Discord.JS, open an issue or try and help out. But for now D.JS is what im making it for.
